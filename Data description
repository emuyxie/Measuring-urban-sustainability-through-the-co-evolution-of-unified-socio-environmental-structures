The paper illustrates how to measure the sustainable urban system characteristics from the case study of Chinese prefecture cities. As of 2015, there were 657 cities in China, including four municipalities directly under the central government, 293 prefecture-level cities, and 360 county-level cities. However, comprehensive fine-scale city statistical data in China are only available at prefecture-level. In addition, there are many autonomous prefectures and leagues in western and northern China. Although they are administratively equivalent to the prefecture-level cities in eastern China, they have low urbanization rates, less developed economies and industries, and sparse population density. They lack statistical data appropriate for measuring urban sustainability. Thus, they are excluded from the case study. As a result, the final dataset includes 278 prefecture-level cities, including 251 in 2000, 267 in 2005, 276 in 2010, and 278 in 2017. The list and explanations of the constructs and measured variables are reported the following table.
